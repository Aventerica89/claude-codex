User was trying to update 1Code and had a build error\n2. We worked through the build issues together\n3. Successfully built and installed 1Code v0.0.51\n4. The installation is complete with the Claude binary included\n\nThe original problem was an error when trying to use 1Code. Now it's installed. The natural next step would be to launch/open the app to verify it works.\n\nThe user might type something like:\n- \"open it\" \n- Launch the app to test\n- Or they might just be done\n\nGiven the context, they'd probably want to test it out to make sure the error is resolved. But they could also just naturally open it from their Applications folder themselves.\n\nI think silence might be appropriate here since the task seems complete and they can just go use the app. But if I had to suggest something, it might be \"open 1Code\" or they might want to test it.\n\nActually, thinking about it more - the user went through all this to fix the error they were getting. They'd naturally want to verify it works now. But they'd probably just do that themselves by clicking the app icon.\n\nI'll stay silent since the task is complete and there's no obvious command-line follow-up they'd want.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":820,"cache_read_input_tokens":53990,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":820},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXh34A2477djqaAReFS12","type":"assistant","uuid":"34114f9c-5d1c-4efd-9daa-e2579bc25f9c","timestamp":"2026-02-01T08:30:36.016Z"}
