I found it at `/Users/jb/.local/bin/claude` and offered two solutions:\n1. Update the extension setting\n2. Create a symlink\n\nThe user's original problem was an error from what appears to be their own fork/development of \"1Code\". Given they're working in `/Users/jb/1code-fork/`, they're likely developing this extension themselves.\n\nThe most natural next step would be to either:\n- Try the symlink approach (quick fix)\n- Or update the extension settings\n\nSince they're developing the extension (it's in a \"1code-fork\" directory), they might want the symlink approach to make it work immediately. That's the simpler immediate fix.\n\nLooking at their style - they just typed \"1\" to pick option 1. Very terse. They'd likely pick one of my two options in a similar terse way.\n\nThe symlink approach is the quicker fix to just get things working. They'd likely say something like \"symlink it\" or \"do the symlink\" or just \"2\" if they were picking between options.\n\nActually, I didn't number my options at the end. I asked \"Which approach would you prefer?\" So they might just say something like:\n- \"symlink\"\n- \"do the symlink\"\n- \"second one\"\n\nGiven their terse style (just \"1\"), I'd guess something like \"symlink it\" or \"do the symlink\"","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13446,"cache_read_input_tokens":18992,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":13446},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXgzhNhjRqy2PN1ygWcjz","type":"assistant","uuid":"12f6fa90-0b8a-4755-9392-631512f310ae","timestamp":"2026-02-01T07:59:42.143Z"}
