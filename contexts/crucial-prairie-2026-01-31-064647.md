**Project:** crucial-prairie (claude-codex landing site)
**Branch:** supreme-marsupial-6367e8
**Working Directory:** /Users/jb/.21st/worktrees/claude-codex/crucial-prairie

## Current Task

Created codex management commands and updated landing site statistics.

## Session Summary

- Created `/codex-sync` command (bidirectional sync)
- Created `/codex-fetch` command (browser-safe fetching)
- Created `/pause` and `/resume` commands (auto state tracking)
- Updated Hero.tsx with accurate stats (40+ commands, 12 agents, 47 skills, 12 rules)
- Added auto-update landing site stats to `/codex-sync`

## Recent Decisions

- Renamed `/sync` to `/codex-sync` for better discoverability with `/codex-fetch`
- Automatic pause state tracking via `~/.claude/pause-state.json`
- No need to remember context IDs - resume is automatic per-project

## Files Modified

- landing/src/components/Hero.tsx (stats updated)
- landing/src/components/EnvVarAssistant.tsx (uncommitted)
- ~/.claude/commands/codex-sync.md
- ~/.claude/commands/codex-fetch.md

## Git Status

## Next Steps

- Merge supreme-marsupial-6367e8 to main for site deploy
- Test /pause and /resume workflow
- Consider adding command cards to landing site
