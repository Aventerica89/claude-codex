# Session Context: crucial-prairie-2026-01-30-235718

## Project
- **Directory**: /Users/jb/.21st/worktrees/claude-codex/crucial-prairie
- **Branch**: supreme-marsupial-6367e8 (merged to main)
- **Repo**: claude-codex

## Session Summary

Created and merged PR #13 with new routine commands:

### New Commands Added
1. **`/routine-sync`** - Smart branch synchronization with decision tree
   - Handles all git states: synced, ahead, behind, diverged
   - Auto-detects conflicts and offers resolution options
   - Integrates with multi-worktree workflows

2. **`/codex-install`** - One-command setup for new machines
   - Clones claude-codex repo
   - Runs install.sh for auto-sync daemon

3. **`/routine-merge`** - Updated with pre-flight sync (Step 0)
   - Now automatically syncs branch before merge checks
   - Ensures you're merging up-to-date code

### Key Decisions
- Integrated `/routine-sync` as Step 0 of `/routine-merge`
- Skipped EnvVarAssistant commits during rebase (had conflicts)
- Merged despite pre-existing lint/link-check failures in repo

### PR #13 Details
- Merged: 2026-01-31T06:56:02Z

## Open Items
