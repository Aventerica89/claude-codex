## Project
- **Path:** /Users/jb/.21st/worktrees/urlstogo/public-clearing
- **Branch:** combative-crocodile-13f267
- **Status:** Clean (all changes committed and merged)

## Session Summary

### Accomplished
1. **Upgraded admin UI to vibrant purple/blue color scheme**
   - Migrated from HSL to OKLCH color space
   - Applied theme from tweakcn.com
   - Updated 177 color references

2. **Fixed critical bugs**
   - Category colors parsing error (500 errors on link creation)
   - Design system page OKLCH variables (Gemini review feedback)
   - User email display (was showing Clerk ID)
   - Branding update (LinkShort → URLsToGo)

3. **Merged PRs**
   - PR #55: Initial color scheme (auto-merged)
   - PR #56: Bug fixes and branding (manually merged)

### Key Decisions
- Using OKLCH color space for better perceptual uniformity
- Fetching user email from Clerk API (not from JWT which doesn't include it)
- Using /routine-merge for future PRs

### Files Modified
- `src/index.js` - Main worker with all fixes

### Verified Working
- Admin page: 302 redirect to login (correct)
- Login page: 200 OK
- Design system: 200 OK with OKLCH colors
- URLsToGo branding present
- Category colors in OKLCH format

## Resume Notes
- All changes deployed to production
- No pending work
- Ready for new tasks
